# Medical Diagnosis Binary Classifier

## Project Overview
This project implements a supervised machine learning model to predict the presence of a disease using patient clinical features.

## Problem Statement
Given patient feature values, the objective is to classify whether a patient has the disease (1) or not (0).

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing
- Feature analysis
- Model training
- Binary classification
- Prediction on masked values

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Required File
- The project requires a `.txt` data file.
- The file must be uploaded manually in Google Colab before running the notebook.

## How to Run (Google Colab)
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload the required `.txt` dataset file using the "Files" panel in Colab.
3. Ensure the file is in the working directory.
4. Run all cells sequentially.
